        <p>Being a dealer can be a fun job, but also a demanding job.</p>
        <p>A dealer is responsible for ensuring that all their guests are compliant with the house rules, from their bets to their demeanor. If a guest becomes too disruptive and begins
          to upset the other patrons, they must be warned and the situation diffused by the dealer or, if not possible, supervisors must get involed. Patrons must be monitored by the dealer
          as well for their level of intoxication. If they become to drunk, the supervisor must be informed so alcohol for that patron can be cut off.</p>
        <p>A dealer <em>cannot</em> get offended very easily, since there are those who become irate when they are forced to follow the house rules, or when they are told they are too
          intoxicated and no longer allowed to drink. While the supervisor and security are the ones tell the patron, the dealer will usually receive the backlash from the patron. Being
          quick to anger or getting easily offended will worsen these situations.</p>
        <p>A dealer is also responsible for game protection, making sure that the house money is guarded at all times. At any given time, a dealer has thousands or more in front of them
          and must ensure that no patron is able to grab the chips in the rack.</p>
