  <h3>About Me:</h3>
  <p style>My name is James, and I am a recent graduate from DeVry. I earned my Bachelors in computers,
    focusing on programming. After a lot of thinking about the direction to take, I decided to
    focus on two types of programming: Android programming and web development. I intend to learn
    more about HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, Node.js, and I have already started learning
    python with the intent to learn Flask and possibly Django. I have a long road ahead, but I
    believe I have a good start.</p>
  <p>My hobbies are Shen Lung(Martial Arts style), guitar, karaoke, writing on a novel, playing ESO on pc,
    and honing my programming skills.</p>
